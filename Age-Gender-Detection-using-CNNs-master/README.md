Age and Gender Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project implements a computer vision solution using Deep Learning to accurately predict a person's gender and age range from a single facial image or a live webcam feed. This serves as an excellent demonstration of deploying pre-trained models for real-time computer vision tasks.

üöÄ Key Features
Facial Detection: Uses a highly efficient pre-trained model for reliable face detection in an image or video stream.

Age and Gender Classification: Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the detected face into specific gender and age categories.

Real-Time Performance: Optimized for detecting and classifying faces in a live webcam feed.

Pre-trained Models: Utilizes models trained by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner, showcasing the ability to integrate state-of-the-art research.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Component

Technology

Role

Primary Language

üì¶ Project Contents
The repository contains the essential files for detection, trained model weights, and performance visualizations:

File/Folder

Description

age_net.caffemodel

Pre-trained weights for the Age Prediction Model (Caffe framework).

gender_net.caffemodel

Pre-trained weights for the Gender Prediction Model (Caffe framework).

age_deploy.prototxt

Network architecture configuration for the Age Model.

gender_deploy.prototxt

Network architecture configuration for the Gender Model.

detect.py

The main executable Python script for running detection on images or webcam.

gender_dataset_face/

Dataset containing facial images (or a subset for demonstration/testing).

*plot.png / detection_matrix.jpg

Visualizations and metrics from the model training and evaluation process.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x installed along with the following required libraries:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy

(Note: If the detect.py script relies solely on OpenCV's DNN module, you might only need opencv-python and numpy.)

Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/vivekmelkani16/Age-Gender-Detection-using-CNNs-master.git](https://github.com/vivekmelkani16/Age-Gender-Detection-using-CNNs-master.git)
cd Age-Gender-Detection-using-CNNs-master

Run detection on a static image:
Place your image in the root directory and execute the script:

python detect.py --image <image_name>

Run detection via webcam (Real-Time):
Execute the script without arguments to utilize your default webcam:

python detect.py

(Press Ctrl + C or Q to stop the webcam feed.)

üìä Performance & Results
The underlying models were trained to predict age within the following eight categorical ranges:
(0-2), (4-6), (8-12), (15-20), (25-32), (38-43), (48-53), (60-100)

The included plots (e.g., *plot.png, detection_matrix.jpg) visualize the training efficacy and the final classification accuracy achieved by the models on the Adience benchmark.
