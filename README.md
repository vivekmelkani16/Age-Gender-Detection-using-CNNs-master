Gender and Age Detection Using CNN
This project is a Deep Learning-based system that accurately detects a person's gender and age from facial images or a live webcam feed. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Adience dataset to classify faces into gender categories and age groups.
